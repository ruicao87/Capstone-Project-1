# Sentiment Analysis of Women’s E-commerce Clothing Review

## Introduction
With the development of the network, there is an increasing number of people choose to purchase online. Given the shortage of information online, customers are always struggling with issues such as size, quantity, colors, and etc. Thus, an overview of others’ reviews can help us get a quick impression of the products.

Understanding customer sentiments not only enhance the efficiency of online shopping but also give the companies an insight as to how the customers like their product. The best way to improve customer experience is by listening to them. The customer’s feedbacks always comes in many different forms and in many different languages. Manually reading all customers’ reviews simply wouldn’t be possible. The best way to solve this issue is to build a technology model to automatically analysis the customers’ feedbacks and the retailer can easily working on improving the customer’s experience. The retailer also can refine sales and marketing strategies or report the important issues that might not be addressed.

## Objectives
1.Attempt to understand the correlation of different features based on an anonymized Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset and indicate whether the review is a positive, negative or neutral sentiment based on recommended, Rating or Positive Feedback factors. 

2.Using Natural Processing Language(NLP) techniques to find the most popular words in the recommended or not recommended review in order to find out which features are most important to customers (color, price, size, etc). 

3.Built the machine learning model and using SHAP to find the most predictable words and LIME to interpret the result.		

## Results
In this sentiment analysis of women’s clothing review project, I believe that  I have made a good machine learning model to predict customer recommendations based on their review text. My model has over 90% precision/ recall on recommended items and 74% recall on not-recommended items which should give the company an overview about customers experience and find the key features that impact their marketing strategy.

I also interpreting the model by using LIME to get more details about which  words or which factors really matters to the customers.There is also something needs to be improved such as an unbalanced sample, Take a more rigorous approach to mine the text data, such as categorizing products, controlling for spelling errors; Apply a more extensive list of algorithms (including Deep Learning) to the text data and create an ensemble of models for better prediction. The company can working on them based on my model.
